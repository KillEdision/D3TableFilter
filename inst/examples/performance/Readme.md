# D3TableFilter - Performance

[D3TableFilter](https://github.com/ThomasSiegmund/D3TableFilter) is a table widget for Shiny built on the [HTML Table Filter Generator](http://tablefilter.free.fr/)  (*TableFilter*) JavaScript library and [D3.js](http://d3js.org/). It tries to be useful for many different applications. In contrast to other widgets, e.g. [DT](http://rstudio.github.io/DT/) it does not provide support for server side paging. Thus it may be not the best choice for large tables where the rendering of the table layout alone is too slow. Tables of up to some ten thousands of cells seem to OK, but your milage may vary, depending on systems used. This app allows you to test different table sizes.
