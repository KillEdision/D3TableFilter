# D3TableFilter - Mixedsort

[D3TableFilter](https://github.com/ThomasSiegmund/D3TableFilter) is a table widget for Shiny built on the [HTML Table Filter Generator](http://tablefilter.free.fr/)  (*TableFilter*) JavaScript library and [D3.js](http://d3js.org/). From TableFilter the widget inherits many different options for sorting, from text and various numeric modes to ip adresses and different time and date formats (See the [TableFilter documentation](http://tablefilter.free.fr/doc.php) for details.). This app demonstrates an additional, sometimes very handy sort mode based on the [gtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtools/index.html) R package: mixedsort.

Click on the column headers to sort the table based on mixed character and numeric values.
