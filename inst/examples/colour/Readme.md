# D3TableFilter Colourful Tables

This is a minimal Shiny app demonstrating the color features of the D3TableFilter widget. An R data frame is formatted as a html table and colorized based on the cell values. D3TableFilter uses the [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) JavaScript library to map data to color. This allows for a broad selection of color scales. This app is not meant to be pretty, but to showcase a few of these scales.
