# D3TableFilter - Features

This app demonstrates some features of the the [HTML Table Filter Generator](http://tablefilter.free.fr/)  (*TableFilter*) JavaScript library. [D3TableFilter](https://github.com/ThomasSiegmund/D3TableFilter)  displays an R data frame as formatted html table using *TableFilter*. TableFilter sorts the table on click on the column headers and can filter the data. 

In addition to the [basic example](https://thomassiegmund.shinyapps.io/basic/) this version has a row counter and  highlights filtered columns. It allows to resize columns and to hide columns. A cookie based mechanism restores filter settings after a page reload. There is also a table footer providing basic statistics on the diplayed rows.
