# D3TableFilter Basics

This is a minimal Shiny app demonstrating the most basic features of the D3TableFilter library. It displays an R data frame as formatted html table using the [HTML Table Filter Generator](http://tablefilter.free.fr/)  (*TableFilter*) JavaScript library. TableFilter sorts the table on click on the column headers and can filter the data. See the question mark in the top row for help on filtering.

You can find more information about the D3TableFilter widget on [github](https://github.com/ThomasSiegmund/D3TableFilter).
