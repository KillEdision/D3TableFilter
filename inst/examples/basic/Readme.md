# D3TableFilter - Basic

D3TableFilter is a table widget for Shiny built on the [HTML Table Filter Generator](http://tablefilter.free.fr/)  (*TableFilter*) JavaScript library. This small app demonstrates some of the features of the *TableFilter* library embedded in a Shiny app. It displays an R data frame formatted as html table. TableFilter sorts the table on click on the column headers and can filter the data.
